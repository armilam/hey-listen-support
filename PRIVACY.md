# Hey Listen - Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 4, 2026

## Overview

Hey Listen is a macOS menu bar application that monitors your calendar events and displays full-screen reminders before events start. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection

**Hey Listen does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data outside of your device.**

### Calendar Data

Hey Listen accesses your macOS calendar data through Apple's EventKit framework to:

- Read event titles, times, descriptions, locations, URLs, and notes from calendars you select
- Display reminders before events start
- Detect meeting links (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet) in event details

Calendar data is read in real time and is never copied, stored persistently, or transmitted to any server. When you close the app, no calendar data is retained.

### User Preferences

Hey Listen stores the following preferences locally on your device using macOS UserDefaults:

- Which calendars you have selected for monitoring
- Alert timing settings (global, per-calendar, per-event, and per-series overrides)
- Alert display mode (active screen or all screens)
- Muted events, series, and title patterns
- Work hours schedule
- Snooze timing preferences
- Startup preferences (launch at login, open settings on launch)

These preferences never leave your device.

### Meeting Links

When you click "Join Meeting" in an alert, Hey Listen opens the meeting URL in your default browser. Hey Listen itself does not connect to any meeting service or transmit any data.

## Third-Party Services

Hey Listen does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app makes no network connections of any kind.

## Data Sharing

Hey Listen does not share any data with third parties. The app operates entirely offline.

## Children's Privacy

Hey Listen does not knowingly collect any information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
